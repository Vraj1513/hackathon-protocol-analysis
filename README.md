# hackathon-protocol-analysis
An empirical analysis of GossipSub vs. OptimumP2P using an automated Python framework to test p99 latency under varying load. Key finding: while defaults perform similarly, configuring OptimumP2P with a high-density mesh makes it demonstrably superior, proving its advanced, tunable nature for high-throughput applications.
